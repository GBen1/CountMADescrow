# CountMADescrow Roadmap

- Improve the accuracy of the reliability index

- Verify that the coins which are sent to the madescrow have been anonymized in an anon->blind tx in their previous tx.

- The lifetime of a madescrow is a data which need to be taken into account in a future version to make it more accurate (in checking the global lifetime norm for the madescrows and in comparing it with the lifetime of the madescrows found)

- Integrate this tool in the script: https://github.com/particl/particl-insight-api
